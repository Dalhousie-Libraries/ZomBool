# About ZomBool
ZomBool is a game in which you try to survive the zombie apocalypse by learning about search strategies and by using boolean operators. The choices made have an impact on the overall story.

## Modifying ZomBool with RenPy
ZomBool was created using version 6.99.12.4 of [Renpy](https://github.com/renpy/renpy). The latest version can be downloaded on [Renpy's website](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html). 

Place ZomBool's main folder and included files directly in Renpy's top level folder - the same folder you use to launch Renpy. If you go to the base directory of the tutorial via the launcher, you can find the top-level folder by simply going up one level. You may need to refresh the launcher after adding ZomBool.

A description of non-standard .rpy files is available at the end of [script.rpy](game/script.rpy).
